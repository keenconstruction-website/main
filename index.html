        <p>Keen Contracting Inc, started in San Francisco
        <script type="text/javascript">years(1999)</script> years
        ago. We have relocated to Dallas in 2019! We specialize in
        custom home remodeling. We can help you get started with any
        size project and complete it with the professionalism of a
        much larger firm, without high overhead costs. We are
        dedicated to each project and have a superior track
        record. Our references speak for themselves. Just call or
        email us and we can discuss your potential project. We are
        open and honest in all our interactions with clients. We
        can help visualize and plan with you any size project.
        Collaboration is the key to success for any project which is
        why we have excellent sub contractors, architects, and
        designers that we can recommend or contract with to give you
        the best value available. We have sustained our business,
        even through tough economic times, by doing two things:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Serving each client as if they are the only client.</li>
          <li>Doing exactly what we say we are going to do.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>"Charlie and his team know how to work miracles in record
          time, on budget, and always with a smile. Charlie has a refined and
          seasoned eye. He is a problem solver, creative thinker and
          relationship builder. We would work with him again and again and
          again."<br /><em>Tina S. - Mill Valley</em></p>

        <p>"We have used Keen Construction for larger reconstruction
          projects and smaller "fix-it" projects for our Oakland
          Historical Landmark Victorian. We selected them because of
          their experience with older homes and their commitment to
          quality work that matches the artisans who built our home in
          1888. Punctual, considerate, clean and professional, we have
          been impressed, pleased and thankful each time Keen
          Construction's crew has come to work on our house. We'd
          recommend them to anyone."<br /><em>Lowry M. - Oakland</em></p>

        <p>"We have been through construction projects several times
          and Charlie Keen and his crew were a blessing to have in our
          home. Their communication and responsiveness were second to
          none."<br /><em>Maralyn T. - San Francisco</em></p>

        <p>"Charlie gave me the most detailed and accurate bid for our kitchen
          and bathroom remodel. Then we added additional work including
          refinishing our hardwood floors and they still finished the entire
          project on the original timeline. Imagine not being stressed out by
          your contractor with a remodel and a baby on the way!"<br /><em>Beth
          M. - San Francisco</em></p>

        <p>"We have had Keen Construction working on our home for 10
          years and we wouldn't think of calling anyone else. Charlie has always
          been fair and covers every detail."<br /><em>Victoria K. - San Francisco</em></p>
